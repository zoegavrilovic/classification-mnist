# classification-mnist

Since github doesn't allow uploading files bigger than 25MB, try downloading the MNIST train set from somewhere on the internet. The one used in this project is downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv/version/2#mnist_train.csv and is 104MB large.
